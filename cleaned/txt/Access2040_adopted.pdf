Air Quality Conformity Determination Certification Statement

   Introduction and Process
ACCESS2040 is the primary vehicle through which the RTC’s planning process is implemented. Inputs to ACCESS2040 came from a large number of sources, including results from the RTC’s Transportation Vision Survey, priorities expressed by the RTC’s Boards and Committees, Federal and state planning requirements, current regional practices, and best practices from professional transportation planning. Underlying Access2040 is an assessment of the current transportation system, its impacts on Southern Nevadans, and identifying transportation infrastructure projects that will improve quality-of-life for residents and visitors to Southern Nevada.
About Southern Nevada
Approximately two million people reside within Clark County and the regional economy supports nearly 900,000 jobs. More than 42 million people visit the region each year, contributing to the regional economy.
Southern Nevada continues to experience rapid growth with recent estimates suggesting population gains approaching 30,000 new residents each year, about half of whom are moving to the region from other parts of the

nation and world. As a consequence, the region displays tremendous ethnic and cultural diversity.
The mobility needs of Southern Nevada are similarly varied, and the goals, strategies, and investment program documented within ACCESS2040 reflect a continuous, comprehensive and coordinated approach to transportation planning.

              Regional Transportation Vision Survey
From January to July 2016, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada conducted an online survey of our region’s transportation priorities. Participants ranked priorities, selected trade-off preferences, and identified broad investment strategies. With nearly 7,000 people participating, the Regional Transportation Commission Vision Survey is the largest-ever review of Southern Nevadans’ attitudes about transportation.
Survey results show that Southern Nevadans want a transportation system that allows them to safely and efficiently access the places they need or want to go while also providing choices for how they travel. Safety and congestion emerged as the top priorities, but all issues received significant support.
• On a scale of 1 (high) to 5 (low), all eight issues surveyed had average rankings between 2.6 and 3.5;
• Seven issues were ranked as priorities by more than half of all participants;
• 90 percent of respondents supported investments beyond their top five priorities; and
• Even the lowest-ranked priority received investment support from more than half of participants.

Goal
ACCESS 2040 GOALS Action
The transportation system of Southern Nevada will enhance and balance our defining regional characteristics:
Strengthen Regional Economic Competitiveness
Strategically develop the transportation system to provide equitable and efficient access to jobs and enhance the region’s attractiveness for business and enterprise.
• Strong and Vibrant Economy,
• Diverse and Welcoming Quality of Life, and
• Valuable Natural and Infrastructure Resources.
Maintain and Enhance Quality of Life for Southern Nevadans
Use improvements and enhancements to the transportation system to ensure that Southern Nevadans can live safely and equitably with access to services and goods they need or want.
These three regional motivators describe the basic elements that allow Southern Nevada to function and grow. All three elements support and reinforce each other; one or another may be more important at any point in time, but the transportation system must support all three. This vision defines an approach to transportation planning that acknowledges the importance of a considered and well-developed transportation system for the Southern Nevada region.
Ensure Sustainable Use of Infrastructure and Resources
Maintain the high quality of existing infrastructure and protect future opportunities by sustainably managing resources and environmental quality.
This Vision Statement and the regional system described above suggest the following three Access 2040 Goals that will support the growing needs of our region and move our regional vision forward.

Economy provides opportunity for jobs and attractiveness for businesses.
Quality of Life ensures that people can live safely and equitably and have access to what they need or want. Resources provide the environment, infrastructure, and materials needed to support the economy and quality of life.
The Access 2040 Plan also presents indicators from the transportation system that will allow the RTC and the region to track progress in implementing the Plan. The strategies and indicators will help direct the Regional Transportation Commission in advancing the vision revealed by the RTC’s Vision Survey and making the goals of Access 2040 a reality.

            Four Primary Strategies
innovations that can reduce high-risk travel behavior and enhance other features of the region that tend to increase safety for all users. Addressing transportation safety will not only benefit our health, but the community’s quality of life, and economic competitiveness.
ACCESS 2040 establishes strategies that will implement the plan’s goals. This section presents the four primary strategies, and a set of six secondary strategies are outlined in the next section. Indicators are also established for each strategy.
2. Manage Congestion
1. Improve Safety
The ability to manage congestion will help sustain the Southern Nevada economy – and better position us to maintain our status in the future as an attractive place to live and visit. Successful implementation of this strategy will ensure that residents will be able to travel and work efficiently and reliably using whichever mode of transportation they desire.
The ability to safely travel throughout the region is a top priority for Southern Nevadans. All users of the transportation system can be at risk, including motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. Safety has long been a focus of the transportation profession, yet transportation users continue to suffer fatalities, injuries, and other losses at unacceptable rates. To improve safety beyond what current design and engineering practices provide, they will be supplemented with

4. Maintain Current Infrastructure
Providing multimodal transportation connections to basic needs and quality-of-life amenities for Southern Nevadans enhances their health and wellness, and makes the region more inviting and appealing for visitors and new commerce. A connected multimodal transportation system of highways, roads, buses, sidewalks, and bicycle facilities can increase access to jobs, housing, schools and amenities locally and regionally, and ensures that the transportation system allows people or goods to get where they need and want to go, how they need or want to go.
Maintaining a safe and reliable transportation system helps ensure optimal system performance for people and goods. With limited resources available for transportation infrastructure confronting the growing region, we must maintain an acceptable state of repair for system assets, and consider replacement costs for aging facilities.

   Six Secondary Strategies
Accessibility Comparison by Auto and Transit
1. Improve Access to Essential Services
Jobs Reachable within 30 Minutes (Auto)
The Southern Nevada region prospers when all residents and visitors have access to the employment, housing, education, medical, shopping, cultural, and recreational opportunities they need. Our region’s transportation system is critical to enabling this movement and providing access to these basic needs and quality-of-life amenities that allow Southern Nevadans to succeed and invites visitors to return.
2. Provide an Accountable and Transparent Planning Process
Southern Nevadans need to know that the resources available for transportation projects and programs are well-spent. A transparent planning and project selection process will help ensure that the goals and strategies of Access2040 are followed, so that residents are provided with a transportation system that meets their needs.
3. Enhance Freight Movement
Facilitating freight mobility and delivery accessibility within the region helps ensure that Southern Nevada continues to remain an inviting place for businesses to thrive and that residents have the goods and materials they need and want. Keeping the region well- connected to neighboring and national markets helps maintain economic competitiveness.
Jobs Reachable within 30 Minutes (Transit)
4. Improve Public Health Related to Transportation
A deliberate focus on the transportation system’s influence on mobility choices, air quality, physical activity, access to healthy food, and the natural environment supports the opportunity for Southern Nevadans to lead healthy and active lifestyles throughout the region, both as part of how they travel, but also through how they live. In addition, ensuring that the transportation system’s impact on air quality is not detrimental to Southern Nevadans is an important part of providing that system.

6. Use Innovative Planning to Address Emerging Technologies & Trends
Significant impacts to natural resources are often a consequence of economic growth and increasing travel demand such as those experienced in our region. Identifying these potential impacts and supporting the conservation and enhancement of natural resources will promote a higher quality of life and help ensure long-term economic opportunity. Protecting natural resources helps residents to lead healthy lifestyles, and enjoy clean air and water by promoting opportunities for active transportation.
Emerging technologies and their growing use will disrupt traditional transportation planning practices. To respond proactively, the RTC will develop innovative planning approaches to address these trends that change how priorities are identified and how decisions are made.

have included “Complete Streets” standards, road diets, and improved infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, which slow vehicles and reduce risks to vulnerable users without dramatically impacting system efficiency.
The ability to safely travel throughout the region is a top priority for Southern Nevadans. All users of the transportation system can be at risk, and will benefit from fewer traffic crashes, fatalities, and injuries. Safety has long been a focus of the transportation profession and this attention has reduced fatalities and injuries, yet transportation users continue to suffer fatalities, injuries, and other losses at unacceptable rates. To continue improving safety beyond what traditional design and engineering practices provide, designs might be supplemented with innovations that can reduce high-risk travel behavior and enhance other features of the region that tend to increase safety for all users. Addressing transportation safety will not only benefit our health, but the community’s quality of life, and economic competitiveness.
Risks of Pedestrian Serious Injury or Fatality Based on Vehicle Speed
Current approaches to transportation safety concentrate on engineering solutions that create an environment with less potential risk from vehicle crashes by removing obstacles and barriers from where vehicles travel. Those same improvements, however, can result in higher vehicle travel speeds that in turn decrease the ability of a driver to regain control of a vehicle, and that substantially increases the risks for vulnerable users like pedestrians, cyclists, or transit users.

Managing congestion
can also reduce traffic
crashes by enabling the
optimal number of vehicles to travel reliably on Southern Nevada’s roads, and communicating crash information to minimize secondary crashes and additional delays. Less congestion and more reliable travel will limit damage and degradation of existing infrastructure, extending its useful life.
The ability to manage congestion will help sustain the Southern Nevada economy – and better position us to maintain our status in the future as an attractive place to live and visit. Successful implementation of this strategy will ensure that residents will be able to travel and work efficiently and reliably using whichever mode of transportation they desire. This strategy focuses on reducing traffic congestion through traffic management and system operations, relieving traffic bottlenecks, and completing the transportation network.
One important element of Managing Congestion is improving system management and operations. The RTC funds and operates the Freeway and Arterial System of Transportation (FAST) program for Southern Nevada, which helps monitor and control traffic on major roads and highways. System management helps make the best use of existing facilities at lower short- and long-term costs than adding capacity.
A major outcome of managing congestion is a reduction in vehicle delays, usage, and emissions that are detrimental to air quality and health. Congestion management needs are assessed through the RTC’s federally- required Congestion Management Process (provided in Appendix G), which identifies the most effective tools available. Managing congestion may sometimes include adding new capacity to existing roads, but this should usually be a last resort because of the high costs and a large body of evidence that new capacity generates additional traffic that wipes out congestion-relief benefits of new capacity within 4-7 years. There are instances, however, where additional capacity or roadway redesign that relieves a particular recurring bottleneck can make a sustainable contribution to congestion management.

facilities that would serve all areas of the region and provide safe and comfortable alternatives to driving. Both the High Capacity Transit Plan and the Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan will be incorporated into ACCESS2040 when they are completed.
Providing multimodal transportation connections to basic needs and quality- of-life amenities for Southern Nevadans enhances their health and wellness, and makes the region more inviting and appealing for visitors and new commerce. A connected multimodal transportation system of highways, roads, buses, sidewalks, and bicycle facilities can increase access to jobs, housing, schools and amenities locally and regionally, and ensures that the transportation system allows people or goods to get where they need and want to go, how they need or want to go.
Enhancing multimodal connectivity can involve increasing the extent of the network of streets and highways when the expansion improves mobility, preferably for more than just vehicular modes. Roadway completions or network extensions for major roads are funded at the request of RTC’s member jurisdictions, and new neighborhood roads are provided by private developers. A map of the expected future roadway network is provided in Appendix P.
Transit system expansion in the future will extend current bus service to new developing areas and increase service on busy existing routes. The RTC has done substantial planning and preparation to develop high-capacity transit on Maryland Parkway, is assessing the feasibility of Light Rail that would link McCarran Airport to the Strip and Downtown, and has initiated a regional High Capacity Transit Plan that will examine regional needs and develop standards and criteria for future implementation of regional services such as Light Rail. Bicycle and Pedestrian needs are being examined in the RTC’s Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan, which identifies future routes and
Efficient connections between modes also enhance the overall ability for residents and visitors to travel within and to/from Southern Nevada. Ensuring that transportation system users can move between modes (vehicles, walking, bicycling, and transit) without barriers or significant delay is a crucial element of improving multimodal connectivity.

                                                           PRIMARY STRATEGY: Maintain Current Infrastructure
The RTC’s effort, called “Seeing Orange” is an ongoing priority of the RTC and will be supported as ACCESS2040 is implemented.
Maintaining a safe and reliable transportation system helps ensure optimal system performance for people and goods. With insufficient resources available for transportation infrastructure in the growing region, Southern Nevada must maintain an acceptable state of repair for existing transportation infrastructure, and apply the best maintenance or replacement strategies for aging infrastructure and facilities.
Maintaining high quality and updated transportation facilities (roads, highways, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, transit facilities, and transit vehicles) ensures the basic safety needs of the traveling public. Deploying the most current maintenance practices and technology will minimize costs and inefficiencies. Transportation facilities in a state of good repair increase reliability and safety by, for example, presenting fewer maintenance irregularities that force drivers, pedestrians, or bicyclists to unexpectedly switch lanes to avoid potholes, cross busy roads in darkened conditions, or enter vehicle travel lanes because bike facilities are covered with gravel or glass.
Maintaining infrastructure in a timely manner with regular minor or preventative repairs saves substantial money compared to waiting until extensive reconstruction is required. This frees up funds for other transportation priorities and reduces travel delays and interruptions from more extensive long-term projects.
Maintenance improvements are often made as part of other projects on the same facility. The RTC works with local jurisdictions and stakeholders, such as utility providers and property developers, to coordinate road construction and reconstruction activities, so that the public can be informed about these projects, travel delays are minimized, and roadway and other facilities are maintained in a good state of repair. In addition to minimizing disruptions, coordinating activities between different parties also reduces construction costs and benefits Southern Nevada’s economic appeal and quality of life.
One way to measure the impact on people and economic activity of a good state of repair for a transportation system is maintenance costs above and beyond normal wear-and-tear. Because Southern Nevada has a relatively new transportation system, roads and highways in the region are generally considered to be in a good state of repair, and vehicle maintenance costs for Southern Nevadans due to poor roads are lower than the national average. But transportation infrastructure maintenance is inevitable and inexorable. Addressing the region’s maintenance needs will continue to help save residents unnecessary costs and enhance Southern Nevada’s economic vitality.

 SECONDARY STRATEGY: Improve Access to Essential Services
SECONDARY STRATEGY: Enhance Freight Movement
The Southern Nevada region prospers when all residents and visitors have access to the employment, housing, education, cultural, and recreational opportunities they need. Our region’s transportation system is critical to enabling this movement and providing access to these basic needs and quality-of-life amenities that allow the region’s residents to succeed and invites visitors to return.
Addressing freight mobility needs and enhancing Southern Nevada’s attractiveness to a high-skill workforce will ensure that the region continues to remain an inviting place for businesses to thrive. Because of the large tourism industry, Southern Nevada relies on freight; the region also receives benefits from freight-related assets and infrastructure. Most freight-related planning will be based on the RTC’s Southern Nevada Regional Goods Movement Master Plan (Appendix W) and results of the RTC’s Truck Arterial Route Study (completion expected in 2017).
Providing a transportation system that meets these needs has long been a core activity for the RTC and local governments in Southern Nevada. Even so, parts of the region have poor accessibility to job centers or key needs such as healthy food, schools, or medical and social services. Increasing access to these essential needs will improve quality-of-life for those residents and the region as a whole.
Safe freight movement is usually provided by design and construction standards that ensure roads and highways can handle freight vehicles. But accessibility for freight – the ability for freight vehicles and goods in general to reach the places they need – is not usually an obvious factor in transportation decision-making. Because freight plays a major role in sustaining the Southern Nevada economy, ensuring these traditionally under- addressed accessibility concerns are part of regional transportation and land use planning will help provide an efficiently-operating transportation system that benefits all users. This may become especially important to other users of the transportation system as the on-demand economy, services and goods delivered directly to consumers may increase delivery truck use on roads and local streets.
Improving access to essential services also serves to formalize that the RTC consider the impacts of transportation projects on disadvantaged Southern Nevadans and attempt to use transportation projects and programs to provide benefits to them. Providing this “Environmental Justice” is a federal requirement for planning agencies such as the RTC; in the past it has primarily meant ensuring that no harm is done to these populations and has been demonstrated weakly by mapping transportation project locations with where disadvantaged populations live. The terms “access” and “accessibility” also refer to improving conditions for people with disabilities, and this strategy includes addressing their concerns and needs. As ACCESS2040 is implemented, the RTC will seek to identify gaps, barriers, and needs for disabled, low income and minority populations, so that transportation projects and programs can specifically benefit them.
In addition to freight from trucks, Southern Nevada is also served by a major railroad that runs through the core of the region, providing freight connections to and from key markets. As manufacturing in Southern Nevada increases, ensuring that rail continues to provide economically beneficial connections without overly interfering in mobility and accessibility of other non-freight modes will be a priority.
In addition, because economic and land use development and transportation infrastructure have a symbiotic relationship, the RTC and Southern Nevada communities will expand work to coordinate transportation decisions with economic and community development decisions. With the RTC’s role in leading implementation of the Southern Nevada Strong Regional Plan, coordinating these activities helps advance that effort. Transportation investments can alter patterns of development, attracting new construction or encouraging efficient infill for under-utilized land areas already surrounded by built-up areas.
Differences between freight and traveler needs have historically presented challenges to planners and engineers, and could continue to make the best investments difficult to determine. A more modern paradigm would prioritize investments by how well they address both sets of needs. The RTC will seek to balance freight movement and quality of life with transportation investments that consider impacts on both types of system users.

        SECONDARY STRATEGY: Provide an Accountable and Transparent Planning Process
c. “Unfunded” projects that need additional planning and development before funding can be assigned.
Southern Nevadans need to know that the resources available for transportation projects and programs are well-spent. A transparent planning and project selection process will help ensure that the goals and strategies of Access2040 are followed, so that residents are provided with a transportation system that meets their needs.
The RTC and local planning and public works departments will coordinate project selection and planning activities so that projects can be selected based on what they are intended to accomplish and how that aligns with Southern Nevada’s transportation vision, priorities, and needs. This process provides effective stewardship and efficient allocation of public funds. Project identification and selection follows an RTC-implemented process designed to meet the following goals:
• Value-based: Selected projects align with Southern Nevada’s transportation priorities, identified through the Access2040 Vision, Goals, and Strategies;
• Transparent and Fair: Process is clearly described and unbiased, and is applied consistently to all potential projects and all jurisdictions;
• Efficient and Equitable distribution of funds: Anticipated spending is distributed across the region based on multiple factors like public needs, population, tax base, etc.
The RTC will work closely with its member agencies to continue using a transparent and fair process for selecting transportation projects:
1. Jurisdictions provide descriptions and Access2040-related
The four Access2040 Primary Strategies closely link the regional transportation vision to projects that are included in the “High Priority” Program list, also called the Transportation Improvement Program. The High Priority Program stages the region’s transportation projects in a short-term 5- year window for construction. It is updated every two years, and the 2017 version contains about $1.5 billion in estimated expenditures. By incorporating Access2040 strategies into this short-range programming, the RTC achieves a strong coordination between Southern Nevadans’ vision for the future and investments being made today.

“High Priority” projects start in 1 to 5 years;
“Medium Priority” projects start in 5 to 20 years or 5 to 10 years, depending on funding source; and

 SECONDARY STRATEGY: Improve Public Health Related to Transportation
SECONDARY STRATEGY: Conserve and Protect Natural Resources
A deliberate focus on the transportation system’s influence on mobility choices, air quality, physical activity, access to healthy food, and the natural environment supports the opportunity for Southern Nevadans to lead healthy and active lifestyles throughout the region, both as part of how they travel, but also through how they live.
Significant impacts to natural resources are often a consequence of economic growth and increasing travel demand such as those experienced in our region. Identifying these potential impacts and supporting the conservation and enhancement of natural resources will promote a higher quality of life and help ensure long-term economic opportunity. Protecting natural resources helps residents to lead healthy lifestyles, and enjoy clean air and water by promoting opportunities for active transportation.
To implement this strategy, the RTC will seek to develop and promote transportation alternatives that encourage more active lifestyles. The RTC’s Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (expected in 2017) and Complete Streets Policy and Design Guidelines can help identify where active transportation infrastructure is appropriate and how it should be designed.
Natural resources in Southern Nevada include undeveloped land, which may eventually be developed, but that also provides areas for recreation, natural habitat for wildlife, and scenic vistas. The provision of roads is necessary to serve newly developed or developing areas, but is also expensive and increases maintenance needs. Undeveloped infill areas provide opportunities to develop land that usually requires only minimal costs for new transportation infrastructure and its maintenance. Continued development along current urban edges can have other impacts to the transportation system that infill development does not, including generating additional longer distance commuters that further clog roadways and create delays unless expensive new capacity projects are added, and usually disproportionately paid for by the region as a whole.
In addition, the RTC will consider the public health impacts of transportation projects and programs, and eventually include those impacts directly in the project selection process. The RTC is also accountable for maintaining air quality standards in Southern Nevada by assessing the air quality impacts of transportation projects, and rejecting or adjusting projects that would result in worsening compliance with air quality standards. Because those standards are established in large part to maintain or improve public health, meeting those standards helps improve public health.
RTC will also identify gaps in access to needs that relate to public health. For example, the RTC identify food deserts, which are defined as areas with a high concentration of low income populations, devoid of full-service grocery stores, and having little access to transit, walking and bicycling facilities. Once identified, plans can be developed to eliminate food deserts and indirectly improve public health.
As travel demand in Southern Nevada continues to grow with economic activity, the need to conserve and protect natural resources needs to be balanced with efforts to prepare and adapt for further economic expansion. With the regional framework described in the ACCESS2040 Vision, the RTC will support efforts to achieve both outcomes in balance, rather than focusing on whether to pursue one objective over another.
By achieving improved public health outcomes resulting from the RTC’s transportation planning and projects, this strategy will improve Southern Nevadans’ quality of life, reduce unnecessary consumption of resources, and enhance the region’s economic competitiveness.

use patterns, transportation revenue, and public transit preferences. With the actual impacts still unknown, the appropriate actions by the RTC (to avoid inefficient uses of resources for projects that may become unnecessary, avoid putting drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists at risk, and accommodate these new trends and technologies) are difficult to determine until these technologies are more extensively adopted. To make smart decisions, some emerging planning-related questions may become:
Emerging technologies and their growing use will disrupt traditional transportation planning practices. To respond proactively, the RTC will develop innovative planning approaches that change how priorities are identified and how decisions are made. These new planning methods – which may take years to identify – will allow the RTC to develop effective, predictive, and timely responses to these disruptions.
• What infrastructure changes may be needed?
• When (or if) it will be appropriate to start changing how or what
Potential impacts are numerous. Engineering research indicates that connected and autonomous vehicles could nearly double effective road capacity, virtually eliminating traffic congestion and challenging the need for more capacity. At a certain threshold across the entire fleet, self-driving cars are expected to substantially reduce overall transportation crashes and fatalities. Transportation Network Companies and autonomous vehicles could drive down public transit operating costs and lead to changes in how transit is provided. RTC analysis of available data already shows that TNC ridership as a share of passengers at McCarran International Airport has doubled over a 6- month period. New ways of travel and vehicle ownership could change land
types of infrastructure or capacity are provided?
• How will these trends influence how and how much people travel,

and how freight and household goods move?
The RTC is initiating a number of ACCESS2040-related actions over the next few years that will help identify and develop these innovative planning methods to manage the transition to new technologies and maximize the positive benefits for Southern Nevadans:

ACCESS2040 Transportation System Indicators
              
           THE CURRENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Highways and Arterials in Southern Nevada
The regional transportation system is composed of roadways, transit, pedestrian/bicycle facilities, and freight-related facilities – with multiple facility types in each group and numerous functions per type. This section will present only a brief overview of the current system in order to orient the reader and set the stage for the recommended improvements that follow. The description of each component is accompanied by relevant challenges ACCESS2040 took into consideration.
Clark County Overview
Regional Roadway System
The current regional transportation system includes more than seven thousand lane-miles of roadway, with nearly a million hours a day spent traveling and 36.7 million miles driven daily in 2015. The majority of the major roadway system is arterial streets – those bringing local traffic to more regional destinations or freeways. People spend more than 34% of their driving time and drive 43% of their miles on highways, including Interstates and other limited-access roads such as US-95 and Summerlin Parkway, which make up only around 17% of the roadway system. Conversely, local roads known as “collectors” comprise almost a quarter of the system, but serve only 8% of travel time and 7% of daily traffic.
| ACCESS2040
21 |
To reduce traffic delays by promoting the use of mass transit and high occupancy vehicles, “Managed” lanes – also known as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes – are restricted to vehicles with multiple occupants during peak travel times. Approximately 22 total miles of Managed/HOV lanes are available on Southern Nevada’s major regional freeways but due to low average vehicle occupancy, they account for approximately 105,000 miles traveled or 2.8% of travel during peak travel times.

                                                                                                  Regional Roadway Challenges
Regional Transit System
Safety ranked as the top priority in the RTC Vision Survey, and is a grave concern for roadway travel in the region. In 2015, the region experienced a significant increase of 21% in transportation fatalities, including a 24% increase in pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities, compared to 2014. Addressing these concerns is reflected not only in ACCESS2040’s goals and strategies, discussed earlier, but also in future projects identified in the High Priority Project lists and future RTP projects.
The Regional Transportation Commission operates public transit for Southern Nevada. The dominant forms of service provided are local bus routes, bus rapid transit (BRT), park and ride/commuter services, and demand response paratransit.
Congestion-related concerns ranked as the second priority in the Vision Survey. Since 2010, miles traveled on regional roadways have grown 18% - substantially more than population growth of about 7% and growth of major road lane mileage of about 12% over the same time. VMT is projected to grow more than 48% by 2040, with major road lane mileage growing by about 18%.
The RTC operates 30 residential bus routes and a variety of routes that operate for special events. These routes provide roughly 78% of regional transit ridership. Residential bus service utilizes different sizes of vehicle depending on the route, and accesses HOV lanes and bus-priority technology where available. The RTC has implemented Bus Rapid Transit on routes running North-South from Downtown Las Vegas to the Las Vegas Strip, and East-West on Sahara Avenue and Flamingo Road, and has express routes serving Henderson, Boulder City, and the Northeast, Northwest and West parts of the urban area. BRT and Express routes make up about 22% of system ridership. Park and ride service uses parking lots or transit centers as an origin and delivers workers to major employment centers. Demand response paratransit service depends on contact initiated by the transit user, and may run along fixed routes or implement route flexibility.
Perhaps a stronger challenge for drivers than congestion is commute times and delays, which can be compounded by development patterns. Although effective system planning achieved a reduction in average commuter travel delay of 6% from 2009 to 2014, average (per-capita) daily traveling times are projected to grow over the next 25 years from 25.1 minutes/day to 28.9 minutes/day (15%). In 2015 Southern Nevada ranked 27th in travel delay per commuter among the nation’s large regions, and 42nd in excess commuter costs. High-growth suburban areas are forecast to experience significant population, employment, and traffic increases, while the dominant form of transportation for households continues to be the automobile. The RTC addresses congestion by implementing a regional Congestion Management Process (CMP) that identifies areas with recurring travel delays and tries to fix them with a series of traffic operations and efficiency improvements before building expensive new capacity.

   Regional Transit Challenges
currently conducting a High Capacity Transit Plan to understand the potential reach of a regional rail-based transit system.
Service area, expansion, and ridership are the prominent concerns among policy makers and RTC as the transit provider. Maintaining a cost-effective transit service that remains attractive to users is an important challenge for the region. Southern Nevada currently operates one of the most cost- effective transit systems in the country, with fare box revenues covering 39% percent of operating funds, but near-term challenges such as increased use of Transportation Network Companies (e.g., Uber and Lyft) and long-term challenges such autonomous vehicles may change people’s travel behavior and impact transit ridership and revenues.
Transit Routes and Paratransit Service Areas
Funding is usually a challenge for transit operators, and will probably continue to impact transit operations in Southern Nevada throughout the ACCESS2040 timeframe. Other than fare box revenue, the only dedicated local revenue source for transit is a one-quarter of 1 percent sales tax. As Southern Nevada’s population and tourism continues to grow, the need for additional transit services of all kinds will be challenged by the lack of long term local funding.
Transit-dependent communities are segments of the population without personal vehicles that use public transportation as their primary source of mobility. The RTC partners with non-profit human service agencies to serve the mobility needs not met by RTC paratransit. Current unmet mobility needs for transit-dependent communities are among the elderly, adults with disabilities, and the poor and homeless needing access to health care. The Coordinated Transit-Human Services Plan (Appendix T) identifies funding/eligibility restrictions, lack of education/knowledge about mobility services, and equipment as the top barriers to meeting these needs.
While the Las Vegas Monorail provides service within a limited portion of the Resort Corridor, Southern Nevada is not currently served by a regional rail transit system. However, the RTC and regional partners have identified the benefits rail transit can provide in terms of increased ridership, increased capacity, higher economic development potential, and enhanced environmental sustainability. To capitalize on these benefits, the RTC has identified Urban Light Rail (Streetcar) as the preferred transit technology on Maryland Parkway, concluded a preliminary needs justification for light rail serving McCarran Airport/Las Vegas Strip/Downtown Las Vegas, and is

  Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian System
Southern Nevada Existing Bicycle Facilities
Bikeways are an integral component of the current and future regional transportation system because they provide a multitude of benefits to the region’s public health, quality of life, access to employment and recreational opportunities, and safety. Southern Nevada currently has nearly 945 miles of on-street bikeways and off-street, shared use paved and unpaved facilities. The region is gaining momentum in creating facilities and destinations for walking and bicycling, with improvements occurring throughout Downtown Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas, and major new facilities including the River Mountains Loop Trail, the Las Vegas Wash Trail, and the CC-215 Beltway Trail. As the regional pedestrian and bicycle network expands, the opportunity for all residents to take better advantage of these travel modes also increases. The 2014 American Community Survey indicates that 3,500 people commute by bicycle in Southern Nevada, and 15,000 walk to work.
The Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan sets out a vision and recommendations for walking and biking to be a viable transportation and recreation asset. Four goals identify what the plan hopes to achieve over time, focusing on comfort and safety, access, education and encouragement, and health and equity. (Appendix V; currently in draft form, but will be incorporated into Access2040 when adopted in 2017).
Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Challenges
Intermodal connectivity is vital to the success and further development of the bicycle/pedestrian system. Where interaction takes place, it should be done safely and effectively, both for the sake of the bicycle/pedestrian user as well as the other mode.
Funding for bicycle/pedestrian improvements does not enjoy a dedicated source, but exists rather as a set-aside amount or with improvements embedded within larger projects. Increasing the transparency about what projects will provide and what outcomes they are expected to accomplish should help Southern Nevadans better understand how the RTC and partner agencies are working to improve conditions for walking and bicycling

   Regional Freight Movement System
The RTC completed the Southern Nevada Regional Goods Movement Master Plan in 2015 (Appendix W). This plan provides a snapshot of Southern Nevada’s freight transportation system, a forecast of future demand, freight- related performance measures, and recommendations to address regional freight deficiencies. The RTC is also conducting a study about freight movement on arterials, and that plan will be incorporated into ACCESS2040 when it is completed. Other potential freight related projects may be identified by the recently-adopted Nevada State Freight Plan.
Another major function of the transportation system is to move goods and services for commercial purposes. The freight industry plays an important role in the economy of Southern Nevada, and is critical for most economic development activities. Trucks carry most goods to, from, and within Southern Nevada. Air cargo and rail carry fewer goods, but air cargo freight is proportionally higher value, while rail freight is proportionally lower value.
Freight trucks move 39 million tons of import and export goods annually in Southern Nevada, but trucks also distribute 40.5 million tons of goods within Southern Nevada. The region’s roadway system provides facilities for this commercial activity. Most truck activity occurs on freeways, highways and arterials. The Interstate-15 corridor carries the most freight traffic, followed by I-515/US-93, CC-215/I-215, and US-95. Arterial traffic primarily provides connections to these more heavily traveled corridors. Improvements to these most freight intensive roadways and infrastructure have potential to benefit both commuters and trucking.
The main freight rail corridor in Southern Nevada is the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) that generally parallels I-15, and connects to Los Angeles-Long Beach and Salt Lake City. This route carries approximately 19 trains/day through the region, with 22 grade-separated crossings, three at-grade crossings, a rail yard, and an intermodal facility. Three branch/short lines connect to the UPRR in Southern Nevada.
McCarran Airport continues to expand air cargo, with 210,000 square feet of cargo and shipping facilities, serving about 100,000 tons of cargo per year. Several hundred trucks pick up or deliver goods to the Air Cargo Center at McCarran each day. This activity was in addition to the 42 million passengers McCarran serves annually.
Pipelines constitute another form of transportation of goods and carry about 5.3 million tons of petroleum, valued at about $2.4 billion annually, to holding tanks in the northwest part of the valley and at Apex Industrial Park. Tanker trucks then distribute petroleum to fueling stations throughout the region. Tanker trucks are on the road 24 hour/day because night shifts are more productive for local fuel station deliveries, and because traffic impacts can be minimized. A major natural gas pipeline is located along I-15, and is part of a system connecting southwest Wyoming to Southern California.

Population and Jobs Forecast
Increasing demand on the transportation freight network will contribute to increasing bottlenecks within the system. Sustaining access to transportation infrastructure and manufacturing sectors within and through Southern Nevada will be critical in ensuring economic competitiveness.
ACCESS2040 updates regional planning assumptions regarding future population and jobs. This supplied the planning process with a fresh perspective on what to expect regarding future travel demand and service area location. The population and employment growth forecast for the Southern Nevada region is impressive. Population in households will grow from 2.1 million in 2015 to 2.8 million by 2040, an increase of 700,000 new- born, migrants and immigrants, or 34% population growth over the next 25 years. Employment will grow from 900,000 in 2015 to 1.3 million by 2040, an increase of 350,000 workers, or 41% total employment growth over the next 25 years.
Similar to challenges confronting the roadway and transit systems, the increase of suburban employment centers will result in the rise of suburb-to- suburb commute patterns, compounding existing congestion, safety, and cost of delivery issues for freight providers. Various types of obstacles may constrain truck movements, including congestion, crash incidents, geometric concerns, and policy issues. The Southern Nevada Regional Goods Movement Master Plan includes a map of specific obstacle locations, recommended infrastructure fixes, and performance measures that will allow the RTC to assess progress related to freight movement.
This level of growth will generate challenges for local and state government planning, especially for transportation planning. One of the leading transportation challenges will be how to deal with population and employment decentralization (See maps on following page), as population growth occurs on the edges of the urbanized area and job growth is distributed across the region. Additional top anticipated transportation challenges are how to serve an aging population and how to minimize impacts of increasing school enrollment and associated drop-off/pick-up trips.
A focus on addressing freight issues is a relatively new element of federal planning requirements, and effectively incorporating freight mobility with the other strategies of ACCESS2040 that are more concentrated on people-focused outcomes of safety, travel efficiency, equity, and health may be a challenge, although the RTC is committed to improving freight mobility and achieving the benefits that will come from better freight movement.
Merely knowing the size of the population does not adequately address the various travel needs a region has. Technical analysis of the status and nature of the population today and in 2040 gives a more full impression of future travel demand and current transportation system performance. Furthermore, federal regulations require analysis to determine the fair treatment of all segments of the relevant population, regardless of nature or degree of diversity. The Regional Transportation Commission’s planning area 53.5% minority or Hispanic, making the region a “majority minority” region. Almost 16% of Southern Nevada’s population lives at or below the poverty level, and

Regionally, an average of 8.5% of households does not have a car, which is overwhelmingly the primary mode of transportation to work in the region. More than 7% of Southern Nevada’s population does not speak English proficiently, and more than 12% of the region’s population is over 65 years old. These statistics reveal a widely diverse population, all with distinct transportation needs according to their life-situation. This reality has been considered in the drafting and implementation of ACCESS2040. The plan demonstrates compliance with regulations regarding Title VI and Environmental Justice based on the analysis completed in Appendix C.

Percent Change in Travel Demand in Southern Nevada 2015 to 2040
Forecasting travel patterns in the future reveals the adequacy of planned investments in confronting current trends and future needs. It is calculated based on the expected changes in geographic location, size, and mobility of population and employment. Also, it takes into account the diversity presented in the previous section. For example, if all the region’s zero-car households were forecasted to locate in one specific area, plans directing relevant services should be adapted accordingly.
Most areas of Southern Nevada will experience increased travel over the next 25 years. Driven by growth of housing, jobs, shopping, and schools, driving time will increase from 877 thousand hours on average weekdays to 1.3 million, an increase of 54 percent. Vehicular travel will increase from 36.2 million vehicle miles of travel on an average weekday to 53.6 million, an increase of 48 percent. Travel patterns will also continue to change during the ACCESS2040 planning period. As growth in suburban and rural areas continues, travel to, from or within the area outside the Beltway (CC-215/I-215) will represent about 46% of all new trips. The largest concentrated increase in travel, however, will be additional trips occurring to, from, or within the Resort Core area, which currently accounts for about 20% trips, but will generate roughly 25% of new trips.
Although the Resort Core area constitutes the highest density of jobs in Southern Nevada, growth of employment outside of the Resort Core has led to additional commuting in traditionally non-peak directions on many of the

Access2040 translates those activity centers, along with the population and jobs distributions presented earlier, into a set of Strategy and Accessibility Focus Areas, which are shown in the map below. In addition to projects being identified by their relationship to the primary Access2040 strategies, projects that address transportation issues in each of these corridors are also identified.
One significant input for developing Access2040 was the Southern Nevada Strong Regional Plan, which was adopted by all local governments in Southern Nevada, and is being implemented by the RTC. The SNS Vision Map, which identifies major activity centers for Southern Nevada, is shown below.

        Access2040 Investment Program
Most transportation revenue is generated based on the concept of “user fees,” where taxes are collected from the users of the transportation system, roughly in proportion to how much they use the system. Currently, fuel taxes are the most feasible means for collecting a user fee-type revenue source.
While the regional vision represents an ideal level of investment, ACCESS2040 applies today’s fiscal reality: federal revenues, those most susceptible to income from the federal gasoline tax, have steadily decreased in recent years. Meanwhile, expenditures (including bond payments) have remained steady at approximately $220 million dollars annually. The gap in investment has been bridged by local revenue sources primarily consisting of indexed local fuel taxes, which provide about 46% of revenue for transportation investments in Southern Nevada over the next 25 years.
Federal revenues are provided by the Highway Trust Fund, which is based primarily on the federal fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline, and has not been adjusted since 1991. State Highway Revenues refer to taxes assessed on the sale of gasoline at a fixed-rate of 18.455 cents on every gallon. Local fuel tax revenues in Southern Nevada, called the “Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax,” (MVFT) have multiple components: a base amount of 15.35 cents per gallon, plus an amount indexed to inflation, which currently adds 10 cents per gallon. (Note: On November 8, 2016, Southern Nevadans approved a continuation of MVFT indexing, which will add approximately 3.5 cents per gallon each year for the next ten years. That result is not incorporated into ACCESS2040, but will be incorporated into a plan revision anticipated in 2017.)
Reasonably Available Revenue
Reasonably available revenue is estimated by the US Department of Transportation, Nevada Department of Transportation estimations, and annual financial reports from the RTC, as well as trends related to debt financing and regional revenues. The total estimated revenue over the course of the ACCESS2040 planning period is approximately $13.6 billion.
These taxes are dependent on fuel consumption and – with the exception of MVFT in Southern Nevada – have not been adjusted since 1991. Increases in vehicle fuel efficiency and a lower rate of VMT growth will impact total revenues generated from this source during the planning horizon. The average fuel efficiency of the light vehicles is forecast to increase from about 21 miles per gallon (MPG) in 2012 to about 29 MPG in 2040. When compared to the RTC’s 2013-2035 Regional Transportation Plan, revenues from federal and state sources are down significantly, while the local fuel tax revenue share of the regional total increases from 20 percent to about 46 percent. This trend is consistent with the overall funding outlook nationally for transportation – that without new revenue sources, federal and state revenues are projected to decrease in absolute and relative terms in the future.

Summary of Investment Strategies
Access2040 implements the four primary strategies (Improve Safety, Manage Congestion, Enhance Multimodal Connectivity, and Maintain Current Infrastructure) by funding transportation projects that are intended to advance one or more of those strategies and achieve outcomes that improve conditions for Southern Nevadans, as expressed by the indicators described earlier and in Appendix I. In addition, investments are identified by how they

              address the overall Access2040 Strategy and Accessibility Focus Areas. Remaining investments fit within the overall regional investment program, which may include projects from prior plans that remain funded in ACCESS2040.
The primary strategy investment categories are listed first, followed by regional focus area investment programs. This presentation format allows Southern Nevadans to understand what the Access2040 Investment Program is intended to accomplish, providing transparency and accountability. Because the goal of an outcome-based transportation plan, such as Access2040, is to identify what the overall plan is intended to accomplish, rather than focus on specific project engineering decisions, this structure further allows project sponsors flexibility to adjust minor details of their project without compromising the representative integrity of ACCESS2040. In many cases, especially for projects not planned for construction for 20 years, exact future conditions are not known, and it may be necessary to update certain aspects of the plan. By representing related investments as programs, and summarizing major investments by strategies and focus areas, the public can be aware of future changes, while local agencies can adapt to the unexpected. The summarized costs shown have been estimated based on the ACCESS2040 fiscal model, previous history, and total cost estimates submitted by project sponsors.
Strategy-Based Investments
Access2040’s major investment approach is to select and fund projects that directly address one or more of the four primary strategies identified earlier. The following chart shows how approximately $13.4 billion will be invested during the ACCESS2040 25-year implementation period. Funding over the next four years – the High-Priority Program – is shown separately, so that readers can see which strategies the RTC and local agencies are targeting for the most immediate planning period.

Regional Investment Program – Uncategorized Projects
Because the transparent and accountable planning process is new for Access2040, some projects that were previously included in an RTC plan or funded project list (the 2013 Regional Transportation Plan, the 2015 Transportation Improvement Program, or the 2016 Capital Improvement Program) have not yet been classified by strategy or accessibility priority.
These remaining projects of the fiscally constrained ACCESS2040 Investment Program are therefore not identified by strategy or focus area, but are still continued for funding. RTC will continue a process to assess these projects so that they are accurately categorized by the anticipated Access2040 revision

Although not identified by their relationship to Access2040 and their expected contribution to Southern Nevada, these projects still serve the region by providing improvements to the transportation system, and include projects that should improve safety, help manage congestion, improve connectivity, and help maintain current infrastructure.
ACCESS2040 Build vs. No-Build Summary
Most transit expenditures fall within this category as well, including: the regional vanpool program; ADA accessibility and paratransit service; preventative maintenance, enhancements, and replacements to the bus and rail systems and vehicles; IT system improvements; and improvements to passenger shelters, facility maintenance, transit centers, and Park & Rides.
driving or riding on a typical weekday, and 0.4 fewer miles driven than if the investments weren’t made. Another way of looking at this, average time spent driving will increase from 25 minutes per day in 2015 to 29 minutes in 2040 with Access2040 investments, but would increase to 47 minutes without them. This time saving provides Southern Nevadans with more time available for activities that can be more enjoyable or productive than driving or commuting. Similarly, driving fewer miles generates additional benefits for residents, including less money spent on fuel, vehicle operating costs, and maintenance, as well as reduced exposure to risks of traffic crashes.
Analysis of the ACCESS2040 Investment Program
Comparing the transportation impacts of implementing the ACCESS2040 Investment Program to a future without the additional infrastructure Access2040 would provide allows an initial assessment of the impacts of Access2040 on key travel indicators. The following table provides the critical measures for this comparison. Overall, making the set of investments identified in Access2040 leads to 18 fewer minutes each resident spends
Overall, the RTC’s analysis of future travel conditions projects a 48% increase in both cumulative travel time and vehicle miles traveled between 2015 and 2040. These increases can be mapped across different geographical regions to provide a better picture of how Southern Nevada will change over the next 25

For this, Southern Nevada was divided into four geographic area types, which are presented on the following map. These zones comprise most of the region’s travel activity, and capture travel statistics in a convenient way. The map’s legend identifies the percent change in total travel time (Vehicle Hours Traveled) in each of these area types.
future regional growth will be concentrated outside the CC-215/I-215 Beltway, especially in relation to current regional population share.
Percent Change in Total Travel Time 2015 to 2040
The Access2040 Investment Program will add approximately 1,300 new lane miles to the regional road system (highways, arterials, and collectors), an increase of 18%. At the same time, VMT is projected to increase a total of 48%, meaning that roads will become more crowded, although with the targeting of improvements on the ACCESS2040 strategies, roads should also function more efficiently.
With much growth in travel activity occurring further away from the historic regional core of the Resort Core area and downtown Las Vegas, local stakeholders should take note of the appropriate ACCESS2040 programs and strategies. This trend is emphasized by comparable data regarding the location of population growth in the year 2040. Analysis suggests much of the
The expected disparity between growth in travel activity and the amount of feasible road expansion, along with other reasonably-anticipated future transportation developments such as expected shifts in travel behavior resulting from increased use of Transportation Network Companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft, etc.) and eventual adoption of autonomous vehicles, indicate a need for the RTC to continue evaluating the Access2040 Plan and Investment Program on a regular basis. These challenges may lead to new solutions or ways of addressing the 4 primary strategies of Access2040. For example, new congestion management methods may be developed that enhance overall mobility, accessibility, and safety. Also, because high capacity transit has a significantly higher carrying capacity than highway lanes serving predominantly single occupant vehicles, it could help to alleviate future challenges. Emerging technologies over the next 25 years – such as autonomous vehicles –may also play a role in negating the disparity between increasing travel activity and additional capacity. Addressing this disparity, however, is at the core of the “Manage Congestion” ACCESS2040 strategy and the Congestion Management Process, both of which the RTC and regional partners will work to implement over the next 25 years.

Fiscal Constraint Analysis
Southern Nevada is currently designated “nonattainment” for federal Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Particulate matter 10 microns or smaller (PM10) standards under the Clean Air Act. As a consequence, the State must develop a plan which demonstrates how emissions critical to the formation of ground- level ozone will be reduced to achieve federal air quality standards. This plan is known as the State Implementation Plan, or “SIP.” Transportation conformity is the process that links the SIP with ACCESS2040 and the RTC’s transportation planning and project funding.
Fiscal constraint analysis is performed as part of the regional planning process to exercise prudence in planning for the transportation future of Southern Nevada. Revenues for future investment are not limitless, and proper governance requires a conservative fiscal approach when considering which improvements are necessary, and in what timeframe. Federal regulations establish this principle into an enforceable requirement of every update of the RTC’s Regional Transportation Plan.
Conformity is demonstrated when the projected regional emissions from on- road vehicles are less than emissions budgets for on-road vehicles contained in the State Implementation Plan. In addition, ACCESS2040 must support the timely implementation of specific transportation control measures designed to reduce on-road emissions. A conformity determination demonstrates that implementation of ACCESS2040 will not cause any new violations of the air quality standard, increase the frequency or severity of violations of the standard, or delay timely attainment of the federal standard interim goals1. ACCESS2040 has demonstrated conformity with the guidelines and limitations, as shown in the table below. See Appendix E for more detail. For each year calculation is required, the forecast measures for both Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Particulate Matter (PM10) fall below the budgets set for the region. Both CO and PM10 are known to be detrimental to general air quality and the health of the environment and Southern Nevada residents and visitors.
Practically, the analysis to demonstrate fiscal constraint limits the total investment by ACCESS2040 to reasonably expected revenues from a combination of sources. The RTC estimated revenues and expenditures through the year 2040, including federal, state, and local revenue sources. Expenditure estimates include construction, operating, and maintenance, divided into the four primary Access2040 strategies or unassigned into a category.

Not all potential projects identified by stakeholders through the ACCESS2040 planning process are included in the ACCESS2040 Investment Program. Many of the improvements with the most potential to change “transportation” as we know it today are outside the reach of available investment dollars – making them “unfunded” with respect to this plan.
collector and arterial levels. The Regional Plan for Streets and Highways is currently being revised, and will be included as Appendix P when completed in 2017; and
These unfunded projects or programs come from more than 15 studies assisted by the RTC as well as local governments and state and local transportation agencies. It also includes projects that were removed from previous plans due to fiscal constraint.
Future updates to ACCESS2040 will need to consider how to advance the regional system closer to this vision.
Examples of ACCESS2040 unfunded projects that support the long-term transportation future for Southern Nevada include:
ACCESS2040 represents a change for how the RTC conducts and presents planning activities. Although regional transportation plans such as ACCESS2040 are required to receive updates every four years, the RTC will treat it like a living document so that it is regularly updated as new studies or plans are completed. This will maximize the benefits to Southern Nevadans of the transparent and accountable planning process established by the RTC.
• $3 billion in projects that will be funded by an extension of local Fuel Revenue Indexing that Southern Nevada voters approved on November 8, 2016. Based on the results of this election, the RTC anticipates a comprehensive revision of ACCESS2040 sometime in 2017 to incorporate these projects and shift other projects’ timing and priority.
The latest version of ACCESS2040 will always reflect the latest recommendations, related plans, current project details, and planned investments for advancing the vision and goals for Southern Nevada’s transportation system.
